## September 1st - September 3rd

### Day

September 1st - September 3rd

Learning stage:
Learn how to build this blog and here we are, Blog with Astro framework... i kinda like the flow of this framework but still... need to improve here and there ü§™ü§™ü§™, as for now... this is what i do... doing the first post.

Some college message me too on this timeframe to get some birthday project script? but i kinda in hurry and just copy and paste from github (literally search for "Birthday Script Github" on google) sorry if you're the one who ask me that question ü§£ü§£ü§£ but kinda want to try that as side project maybe(?).

Lastly, i've been Experimenting with my food on this timeframe, actually some days before that. I inspired by Musashi Miyamoto's Principle named [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokk≈çd≈ç](Dokk≈çd≈ç) about mindfullness. I currently took the example come to realization, Eat for sake of living... and eat what you get, don't get succumb to the taste.

While eat do it mindfully and don't get distracted, when i do it on first try i force myself to focus on eating and slowly chew to thanks god what we got. I apply those and the bowl that i usually need more half of it to be full, out of no where i got burp even tho the bowl is not finished. I really enjoy the time i eat and really enjoy every chew... i mean it üò§üò§üò§

### Satisfaction

80/ 100 I think, it's productive enough but need some improvement, just passing the line of OK-ish

### Daily activities

Just usual things
Wake up -> Work -> Side Project or Gaming -> Sleep

### What to Improve

I need improve the styling on web, digging more about Dokk≈çd≈ç, and want to try some web dev (maybe backend dev [?])
