## September 4th - September 6th

### Day

September 4th - September 6th

### Notable Changes

I randomly stumble on Ludwig's Livestream and it's kinda end of the stream he play [Porter Robinsle](https://porterrobinsle.com) by [Ottomated](https://www.twitch.tv/ottomated) who is behind the app that ludwig always use (like drawer for his banner challenge, chat stock chooser, etc) maybe i will look up to him later for some coding reference, but hey.... this Porter Robinsle things can be new segment on my youtube channel's short Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯. if you wondering what youtube? [Here is the channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Gridd3902), but i kinda lazy for now as i cope to this blog things. Here's Protein Ribosle Result on 5 September 2024 :

Speaking of Porter Robinson, when i play [Is There Really No Happiness?](https://youtu.be/PoTu269qSnw?t=179) the nostalgia hit as i open my facebook and saw my post on my junior high school. Something caught my attention, familiar name in comment.... yeah my buddies from online messaging app "Nexian Chat" or something... alternative for Blackberry Messenger on that day on android, Andddddd the nostalgia hits hard as i remember all that we've been through. The core memory with this person is i fucking go to nearest peak on my area to see firework to literally impress her. Such a good time memories, and for you whom may don't even know who i am right now.... hope you're alright.

Alright let's reset the mood and talk about the matter. Don't you feel any difference on this blog? yeah i update the look to be more simple but cool. But sadly because i have very little time in between my lunch break, so i have an idea. i want to try V0 by vercel. They named it V0 because it's courage to people to make what's on their mind and create the App V0 (Most Viable Product / Prototype). It's literally Chat GPT with twist and some functionality for dev such as code preview, optimization, etc. With all those benefit, ofcourse there's downside. V0 free session is much muchhhhhhhh shorter than GPT 4.0 free tier. It kinda a quarter of GPT 4.0 session, if we use GPT 4.0 maybe achievable on half time of GPT 4.0 free tier.

### Satisfaction

60/ 100 I think, it's productive enough but too much nostalgia that can make me cry, probably

### Daily activities

Just usual things
Wake up -> Work -> Side Project or Gaming -> Sleep

### What to Improve

Need new playlist music for grind, need new end product that make me curious (i kinda intersted in plotting stream data like crypto or stock)
